# AgroSense-Intelligent-Crop-Weather-Recommendation-System

AgroSense is a data-driven machine learning project designed to recommend suitable crops based on weather conditions and seasonal patterns. The system helps demonstrate how data analysis and machine learning can be applied to real-world agricultural challenges, focusing on sustainability, productivity, and informed decision-making.

This project was developed as part of a national-level hackathon and showcases practical implementation of machine learning, data preprocessing, prediction, and visualization techniques.
